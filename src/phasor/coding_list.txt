input: phasor and time
function: sine function (amplitude, frequency, phase, dc offset)
output: value

implementation:
phasor.cpp
float phasor_at_t(complex phasor, time t);

2-2. DONE
AC voltage input (amplitude, frequency, dc offset)
to phasor for calculation

2-3 DONE
Current Source 

3. DONE
finding which library to use for matrix calculation
need to find inverse,
matrix multiplcation,
etc.

4.
using our netlist store information in some way for now (data structure later~)
it is important to store information as conductance matrix and voltage matrix and current matrix.
given N nodes: conductance matrix = [N x N], voltage matrix: [N x 1], current matrix: [N x 1]

before these matrices are used for calculation, some modification to matrices must be done:
implement a function: conductance of V_source simplification -> 말로 설명하는게 편할듯 -> 맨 첨부터 이게 가능하면 젤 efficient
easy for V_sources (GND, other component connection)
hard for V_sources (one component, the other component connection) -> supernode.

5. DONE
implement a function: float find_conductance(str left_node, str right_node, component comp)

6. DONE
add test cases: series RLC, parallel RLC, etc.
later: supernode with multiple voltage sources and diodes.
